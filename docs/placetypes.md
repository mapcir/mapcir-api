# Place Types

This page lists the supported values for the **types** property.

* [Table 1](#Table-1-Place-types) lists the types that are supported for place searches, and can be returned with Place details results, and as part of autocomplete place predictions.

* Table 2 lists additional types that can be returned with Place details results, and as part of autocomplete place predictions.

## Table 1: Place types

The Place type values in Table 1 are used in the following ways:

* As part of a Place details response. The request must specify the appropriate "types" data field.

* As part of an Autocomplete place prediction. For more information on the rules for using these values, see Places Autocomplete.

* In the type parameter for place searches (Places API only), to restrict the results to places matching the specified type.
